          <h1 class="section-title">Harvey's of Stretton</h1>
          <p>
            Harvey's of Stretton was a web application created as part of my
            Computing HND web development assignment. It was a simple database
            management system with a basic UI for users to navigate the app. It
            was created with HTML, CSS for the frontend and used MySQL within
            HeidiSQL and XAMPP. I also used PHP to connect the frontend to the
            backend.

          <h2 class="section-subtitle">Project Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            A fictional company needed a web application that would allow them
            to access their company databases, view and modify the information
            within them and be able to search for specific customers or
            vehicles.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-subtitle">Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            As it was done for an assignment for my HND course, there were some
            limitations to what could be done. First off, we had to use
            applications that aren't necessarily what would be used in the real
            world (i.e., HiediSQL and XAMMP) to create the databases to be
            linked using PHP.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-subtitle">Problems and Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            The most notable problem was the fact that this was the first web
            development project I ever did meaning everything that I was doing
            was new to me. I had to learn how to write HTML, CSS and PHP so that
            the frontend would link up properly with the backend. For the first
            week or 2 of the assignment duration I spent learning PHP and how to
            get a basic database setup with HeidiSQL and XAMMP.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-subtitle">Results</h2>
          <p>
            As a first front end development project I was happy with what I
            created however I think now after having 1 year of knowledge I think
            I could recreate it in a much better way. I could make the UI the
            web application uses much better mainly because it wasn't
            responsive, and the PHP could be rewritten to make it more readable.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-subtitle">Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I think in the near future I want to entirely revamp this project
            and recreate it using my new found knowledge after having done a
            handful of projects to see how I have progressed. I want to be the
            only limitation to be my ability and not restrained to using certain
            pieces of software.
